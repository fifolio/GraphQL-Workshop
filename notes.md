# What is Apollo-Server-Express

apollo-server-express is a middleware that allows you to easily create a GraphQL server using Express, a popular web framework for Node.js. It is part of the larger apollo-server package, which provides a variety of tools and integrations for creating GraphQL servers in different environments.

With apollo-server-express, you can define a GraphQL schema and resolvers, and then use them to create an Express middleware that handles incoming requests and sends back responses. This allows you to easily build a GraphQL API that can handle complex queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

# What is "typeDefs", and "resolvers" in gql?

In GraphQL, typeDefs and resolvers are two important concepts that are used to define and implement a GraphQL schema.

typeDefs stands for "type definitions" and is a way to define the shape of your data in a GraphQL schema. It allows you to define custom types and their fields, as well as queries, mutations, and subscriptions. For example, you might define a custom type called User with fields like id, name, and email.

resolvers are functions that are used to resolve the values of fields in your GraphQL schema. They take in arguments (such as query parameters) and return the corresponding data. For example, you might define a resolver for the User type that fetches user data from a database based on the id field.

Together, typeDefs and resolvers make up the implementation of a GraphQL schema. The typeDefs define the structure of the schema, and the resolvers provide the logic for how to fetch and return data from that schema.

# What is Apollo Client

Apollo Client is a powerful JavaScript library that enables you to fetch data from a GraphQL API and manage that data within your application. It allows you to write concise and expressive queries that only return the data you need and provides a range of features, such as caching, error handling, and real-time updates, to make working with GraphQL APIs easier.

# What is Apllo Provider

ApolloProvider is a React component that allows you to connect your React application to an Apollo Client instance. It wraps your application and makes the Apollo Client instance available to all components in your application using React's context API. This makes it easy to use the Apollo Client instance to fetch and manage data within your components.

# What is InMemoryCache

InMemoryCache is a caching implementation provided by Apollo Client. It is used to store the results of GraphQL queries and mutations in memory so that they can be quickly retrieved and reused without having to make another network request. InMemoryCache also provides a range of features, such as query normalization and data de-duplication, to ensure that your application's data is consistent and up-to-date. It can be configured to work with a variety of storage systems, such as local storage or IndexedDB, to provide persistent caching.

# GraphQL resolver arguments

> the args parameter is used to access the arguments passed to a particular field in a GraphQL query. You would use it in resolver functions where the data returned by the field depends on the arguments passed in the query.

> The parent parameter is used when you need to access data from the parent object of the current field being resolved. Whether or not you need to use it depends on the structure of your schema and the data you're trying to access.

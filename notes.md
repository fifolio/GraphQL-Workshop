# What is Apollo-Server-Express

apollo-server-express is a middleware that allows you to easily create a GraphQL server using Express, a popular web framework for Node.js. It is part of the larger apollo-server package, which provides a variety of tools and integrations for creating GraphQL servers in different environments.

With apollo-server-express, you can define a GraphQL schema and resolvers, and then use them to create an Express middleware that handles incoming requests and sends back responses. This allows you to easily build a GraphQL API that can handle complex queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

# What is "typeDefs", and "resolvers" in gql?

In GraphQL, typeDefs and resolvers are two important concepts that are used to define and implement a GraphQL schema.

typeDefs stands for "type definitions" and is a way to define the shape of your data in a GraphQL schema. It allows you to define custom types and their fields, as well as queries, mutations, and subscriptions. For example, you might define a custom type called User with fields like id, name, and email.

resolvers are functions that are used to resolve the values of fields in your GraphQL schema. They take in arguments (such as query parameters) and return the corresponding data. For example, you might define a resolver for the User type that fetches user data from a database based on the id field.

Together, typeDefs and resolvers make up the implementation of a GraphQL schema. The typeDefs define the structure of the schema, and the resolvers provide the logic for how to fetch and return data from that schema.
